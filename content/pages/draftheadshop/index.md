#### Which Head Shop Is Best?

Imagine seeing a YouTube video or reading a review about an amazing new bong or vape. Then when it arrives it feels cheap and flimsy, and only lasts one or two sessions before clogging up or breaking. Sadly, most cannabis companies can be a little shady and sell either fake products or worse. Utter crap, that ends up sitting in your draw and wasting your hard earned cash that could have gone towards buying that extra ounce. Being vigilant and spending a few minutes reading our buyer’s guides can save you from the waste and stress dealing with less than reputable providers. We only recommend the very best cannabis related products and companies to promote.

Whether you are looking to buy a new glass bong, dab rig, vape, grinder, smoking accessories or even just some rolling papers we got your back and review the best gear that actual real stoners are using daily.

So forget the hype, roll a blunt, sit back and browse our guides until you feel comfortable you are purchasing the very best products.

## Toker Supply – 420 Satisfaction Guarantee Returns.

Toker Supply is one of our top pics when looking for stoner supplies. With their large selection of products, stealth shipping and excellent return policy they have risen through the ranks to become a top online smoke shop. If you recently broke a glass bong they even offer a discount with their generous #RIPiece Program. All three of our top 3 offer extremely competitive pricing and discount models to keep customers completely satisfied.

One cool thing about Toker Supply is they offer 24 hour support via live chat and telephone. The customer service is second to none, and whenever there is an issue they are keen to solve it.

Another cool thing about Toker Supply that the others do not really offer is the free gifts they always throw into the order. They also always bring trending new products stoners have never really seen before onto the market before others. This alone is worth bookmarking them!

Our favorite section of their online shop is the Bundle deals and Dab Rigs under $100!

### TokerSupply headshop is one of our favorite’s

Tokersupply headshop offers a huge selection of sick stoner gear, bongs, bubblers, recyclers, dab rigs, ash catchers, glass hand pipes, herb grinders, rolling papers, and dab nails.

Each piece hand selected and are high quality and not your average pieces you find in your local headshop. They also ship super stealthy and have a sweet return policy in case things go wrong along the way. And even have free shipping on all USA domestic orders!

They always ship out within 24 hours of ordering in a discrete brown box and even overseas orders are shipped pretty quickly. The return address even just says “T Supply” to increase the stealth, which we found was a nice touch!

### This company feels a lot like it is run by real stoners

With sick new glass we have not seen anywhere and up to date dab trends, everything is on point! Every purchase in their store is backed by their 420 satisfaction guarantee, meaning anything you not super stoked with you can return for a full refund.

They are super popular among stoners, with over 500.000 fans on social media and 2900 certified reviews on Yotpo!
With 24 hour support by phone or live chat it hard not to see why. TokerSupply is also the only online headshop to offer discounts on your next orders when you break your beloved glass piece, making those crappy moments not as bad.

It does not even have to be a piece from them! And all they really ask for in return is you to post a pic on Instagram using their #RIPiece hashtag.

### TokerSupply does not have high overheads
